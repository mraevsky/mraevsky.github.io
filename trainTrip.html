          Reasonable arguements against a cross country train trip may include claustrophobia, motion sickness, opportunity cost of time, loneliness, and monumental boredom. Indeed I was just an observer on a vessel travelling through space-time, completely powerless in my ability to accelerate or otherwise change my physical trajectory. 

          <br><br>But it was precisely these conditions that triggered deep meditation – viewing things, events, and people as “good” or “bad” was pointless because such opinions held absolutely no impact. Instead I was simply and wildly intrigued by what <i>is</i>. Cultures, cities, and landscapes gradually morphed from one to another. Eccentric people who I would have never otherwise met stumbled into my life and altered it forever.</p>

        <h6><u>Day 2: Great Lakes to Chicago</u></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
        Arriving in downtown Chicago around midday, I felt a mix of Amsterdam and New York vibes: a huge, modern, sky-scrapping financial district and canals interweaved by bike lanes. Instinct directed me towards renting a Divvy bike on which I quickly escaped what was cleverly named “the loop”. Despite excessive Pokémon Go traffic, it was great to see a beach walking distance from town not packed like sardines (i.e. Coney Island...)

        On top of exploring a city I’ve never been to, two other wildcards awaited me. Dinner with a friend of a friend of a friend and staying overnight with a guy I’ve met only once. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first episode, Anastasia and I successfully identified a remarkably large amount absurdities we witnessed, probably inherent to private universities on the east coast. Funny how many people in the US are so conditioned to always be making money, spending money, or not knowing what to do with themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon arrival at Kief’s similar ideas resurfaced; there is evidently much perspective to be gained from living in as many regions of the country as possible. To current TEPs – the older generations provide fascinating insights on the world’s mysteries, whether they are about the holes and bones of foam or about careers and the wonders of real life. I strongly recommend outreach, as it is humbling and invigorating to stand on the shoulders of giants.
      <p>


      <h6><u>Day 3: Chicago to somewhere in Nebraska</u></h6>
      <p>
        On the way to Denver I quickly befriended Jack – a current resident of the Shambhala Mountain Center, Sarah – an incoming masters in poetry student at UW, and Travis – an ex-barista travelling on a one way ticket to Denver with no disposable income and no acquaintances in Colorado.  Hearing their backstories over the Nebraska sunset reaffirmed that I am indeed on a spiritual journey.

        Jack and I had no rush to get to our next destinations, so we decided to go explore Denver with Travis the next day. Planes and cars draw people focused on getting from point A to point B. Trains however draw a specific personality type – one that is eager to embark on a journey of unknowns, willing to spend time meditating on the nature of reality, eager to share food, living space, and ideas with strangers. The generosity and patience of these people rubs off, even on fast-paced urban rats like myself.

      <p>
        Jack (left), Travis (right) and I decided our first move was to visit a supposedly famous <a href="http://www.boulderteahouse.com/">Tajiki Tea House</a> in Boulder. On the bus up to Boulder Jack showed a highly enlightening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rEb0KuopI">short clip</a> that contributed to his spiritual liberation by convincing him to embrace buddhism and drop out of the rat race. Among the teahouse’s 5-page menu of only teas, I ordered my favorite Japanese Sencha – one of the holiest herbs on this planet. If you haven’t heard it from me already, tea (especially green tea) has a chemical called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">l-theanine</a> that doesn’t exist in coffee and suppresses the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine. You can never drink too much green tea. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Travis asked the waiters about camping spot recommendations and found a road that went straight into the mountains from Boulder. We all went on a short hike, and were stunned to find that only 20 minutes from downtown you could escape any trace of civilization.  After minor mountaineering Jack and I had to make our way back to Denver, saying our goodbye’s to Travis and wishing him the best for his wildly new lifestyle. (Travis, if you see this, please reach out – would be great to hear how you’re doing!)

   <h6><u>Day 5: Denver to Utah</u></h6>
   <p>
    The gnarliest part of the journey, a 35-hour segment from Denver to San Francisco was also coincidentally the most therapeutic. I’ve seen the Rockies in December and January, covered in pow ready to shred, and am happy to report that they are just as stunning in the middle of August.

        On the left is Moon River, a beautiful stretch of camp-able beach. Only the once-a-day California Zephyr train I was on ever disturbs the campers – and every single one of them retaliates by mooning the train as it passes by. On the right is the valley that contains Winter Park, a holy location I was lucky enough to visit with 35 other degenerates this past year. Shout out to my Penn Ski fellas. (If you think my man Albert is a savage in the park, you better check out what these mountain bikers have the balls to do in the summer…)
      </p>
      <p>This trip had it’s own special dose of people. Depicted in the bottom right, reading a magazine, Sam was telling me about how he never stays in hotels because hostels are 3x cheaper and you make 3x as many friends. Hostels made my journey possible and better, and I strongly recommend to everyone reading. Either way, Sam told me about how he recently couldn’t find a hostel, and elected to stay with homeless people instead of at a hotel. But he had the money to buy 4 people he just befriended on the train a beer each. One selfless hell of a guy.

          When I went down to the food cart I overheard a 60 year old dude from the Midwest complaining about the fall of the Midwestern economy. Skepticism and curiosity convinced me to engage this vibrantly anxious grandpa-in-a-stoner-hoodie. Turns out he had quite a powerful and factual tale about the utter deterioration of the region because of commercial agro-business behemoths and unethical farming practices. He was so visibly shattered by it that his arms were trembling and his fingers were twitching.

      <h6><u>Day 6: Somewhere in Nevada to The Bay</u></h6>
      <p>
        6am sunlight over the Nevada desert sent me from sleep to meditation. After a multi-hour momentary lapse of reason, I brewed myself a tea and made moves to the observers cart. Almost immediately after sitting down, yet another pair of crazy individuals stumbled into my life: a ~30 year old couple who had spent the last 60 days biking from their home in Vancouver all the way to Denver, camping overnight and surviving on a $15/day food budget. An unforgettable reminder about time being more valuable than money: one resource is recoverable, the other isn't. And they had plans to bike back home from San Francisco up the coast.
      </p>

      <h6><u>Day 7: the east part of the bay to San Francisco</u></h6>
      <p>
         Before entering downtown SF, I stayed at my Dad’s best friend Nico’s house, who is a Chemical Engineering PhD working at Chevron. He took me kayaking and showed me some awesome sea otters in utter bliss of the vast oil contraptions built a couple hundred feet away.

        It's always a fascinating time trip to reuinite with people from your distant pass. The disparity between your current and previous impression of someone is not only indicative of them, but also of disparities between your current and previous self.

        In the afternoon Nico dropped me off at the BART station which took me into downtown. The first peep out of the subway’s tunnel hit me like stepping foot in a foreign country. There is something so damn unforgettable about the demeanor in which SF presents itself, although I couldn’t pin it on any one thing. I was breathing Ocean, not waste. I was surrounded by palm trees and a pervasive scent of coffee. I was shattered by the fact that there was actually a place more expensive than New York.

        At night I moved to Rosenbluth’s 13-person house of programmers. It’s quite inspiring to see not only the willingness, but the eagerness to be in a constant state of learning, failure, and evolution among the young techies of the valley. Definitely an honorable way to spend a lifetime. The air was so liberatingly clean compared to New York that I opted to sleep out in Rosenbluth’s backyard. No regrets. Here’s the not-so-shabby view out his back porch.

      <h6><u>Day 8: Palo Alto / Menlo Park</u></h6>
      <p>
        After an unfortunately expensive but appropriately amazing coffee, I hopped on a train that took me south to Menlo Park. My instincts drove me to go explore Stanford before getting to the tech behemoths. I ended up spending all day there – it had the campus of a beautiful and secluded liberal arts college with the heart of a world-warping engineeering school.

      <h6><u>Day 9: Biking like a madman through San Francisco</u></h6>
      <p>
        For some reason, San Francisco was the only city on my route that doesn’t have a 24-hour pass bike sharing system. What’s up with that? Anyways, I rented a bike in the Mission and went straight to Haight, the cities hipster heaven. Coffee shops, smoke shops, alternative medicines, and alternative bookstores popped up on every block. First time passing through a slice of the world anything close to this.

        After a severe underestimate of the cities size, my bike rental was ending so I dropped it off back at The Mission and took BART west into Berkeley. Skylar picked me up in the most hippie vehicle I’ve ever had the honor to ride in. Immediately after, I had an even bigger honor to stay in his Dad’s office overnight – a room covered in plans to build the next generation of sustainable technologies. I stayed up for a while mentally downloading and processing all of this invaluable information. This guy transferred from Columbia to Berkeley. What a power move. 
      </p>


      <h6><u>Day 10: Downtown SF and hills above Berkeley</u></h6>
      <p>
        Met up with Spencer who showed me one of the best-kept secrets among the Penn community: the Wharton MBA San Francisco building. It’s apparently open to undergraduates and makes Huntsman feel like DRL. About half the day must have passed by the time my brain hit overheat from constantly streaming information from the encyclopedia that is Spencer.

        The previous day, I had just missed the Berkeley sunset, so this time around I made moves back to Skyler’s a couple hours earlier. He took me so far into the hills that we surpassed the clouds, and even the mighty Berkeley National Labs.

        In the whole bay area you can so quickly you can get from an urban center to the middle of nowhere, from a beach to a mountaintop, or from artists to technologists. It’s one diverse hell of a place.

      <h6><u>Day 11: Berkeley to NorNorCal</u></h6>
      <p>
        The final day in the bay was spent in thorough investigation of Berkeley. Roaming around the campus and the town reminded me of Ann Arbor. It was enlightening to learn that you only have to live in California for a year if you want your Berkeley tuition sliced in half. </p>

      <p> The nature – city contrast was unlike anything I’ve seen before. People were swimming and drinking beers right across from downtown skyscrapers. (Imagine going for a dunk in the Hudson.) Really goes to show the environmental consciousness of every individual involved. What was also stunning is how open strangers are to conversing. I got many questions about the bike I rented and the clothes I was wearing. Unlike Locust Walk or downtown NY, almost nobody was walking the streets with their headphones in – as if everyone is almost eager to stumble into some conversation. </p>

      <h6><u>Day 13: Exploring Portland</u></h6>
      <p>
        Upon waking up real late, I befriended Bart who was staying in the same hostel as I. He turned out to be from Antwerp, a Belgian town within an hour of where I’ll be studying abroad next semester. Bart looked like a stereotypical 30-year old philosopher, with more beard than head hair and had just come back from spending the previous 5 weeks venturing through Alaska. I got some great pointers on how to afford spending that long in Alaska, a voyage I hope to embark on ASAP. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After breakfast, my immediate move was to explore the mountains that surrounded Portland. I hopped on a subway that took me West, and 5 minutes later I got off, deeper into the earth’s crust than I’ve ever been. In order to get out of the subway, I had to take a 750ft elevator going vertically up.  The doors opened and I was surrounded by 360 degrees of wilderness.

      <p>
        I took a path that had many twists and turns, and featured a complete lack of any other people. It spat me out at an enormous rose garden with a stunning background view of Portland and Mt. Hood.

        Right down the road there were also the Portland Japanese Gardens. It was probably the most apt place in the US to have an establishment like this, but it still felt unsatisfactorily out of place.

      </div>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thereafter I began my long and gradual descent from the mountains back towards the direction of the hostel. Hung out with some people staying at the hostel from all over the place, including Michigan and Massachusetts. One of the dudes was about to wake up at 5am the next day to go on a city-wide bike race.

        My first impression of Seattle was somewhat negative because of the industrialized zone near the train station. Fortunately, as soon as I hopped on a bus up to Reife’s house Seattle appeared the way it truly is – the natural appreciation, liberal culture, and bike-friendliness of Portland and the technological and urban drive of San Francisco. A block from my destination bus stop, Ava sprinted at me like a bullet. She’s Reife’s black lab who was part of the legendary summer 2015 foam squad. Great hospitality from Reife himself, but he was a lot more mild than Ava.

      <h6><u>Day 15: Ferrying and Biking through Seattle</u></h6>
      <p>
        After taking a bus back downtown from Reife’s and having what might have been the best coffee I’ve tried, I instinctively hopped on a ferry to Bainsbridge Island on the other side of the Puget Sound – one misty hell of a river.

        Besides the humbling amount of natural forces on the water, the port town wasn’t too thrilling. Except that I found this sign mentioning a Scandinavian town by the name of Poulsbo on the other side of the island, which I instinctively visited by bus.

        I came in with no expectations, and saw a tiny couple-block town with more boats than cars. There was one bookstore though that was heavily loaded up on eastern literature, which I appreciated. Grabbed a super old copy of Alan Watts’s book for my voyages through Europe. It definitely left me eager to visit the real Scandinavia.

        After making moves back to Seattle, I decided to bike all the way to the east edge of the city to meet up with Reife and Ava at a dog park. I’m becoming more and more convinced that dogs generate unparalleled happiness and energy. Eventually we made moves back to Reife’s and met up with Kotter. It’s quite fascinating to observe how the utter curiosity, risk tolerance, and intellectual interests of dark side stay relatively consistent throughout many generations.

      <h6><u>Day 16: Seattle to Vancouver</u></h6>
      <p>
        My train ticket had expired by this point, but I felt obligated to check out Vancouver given how close I was. Luckily I found a $30 greyhound ticket that brought me there and back, and another nature-loving Couchsurfer willing to host me.  I witnessed an unbeatable sunset at the port before I made my moves to Vancouver.

        Upon arrival in Vancouver I was greeted with a tour of the whole city. I was quite tired but I remember agreeing to going fishing the following morning with my host. This guy must have been one of the most bizarre I’ve met this journey – ask me about it sometime. 
      </p>


<div class="Vancouver" id="Vancouver"></div><br><br>

      <h6><u>Day 17: Vancouver & Victoria</u></h6>
      <p>
        It must have been before 4:30am when Jeff woke me up to go fishing – but I have absolutely no regrets. A 25-minute car ride from downtown, on the other side of the river, a magical view of the city appeared. I must have spent three hours watching this sunrise, with not the slightest desire to move anywhere. 
      </p>

      <div class="row">

      <p>
        After fishing, I rented a bike to go explore Stanley Park – a park so big that it’s area is roughly equal in size to the rest of the downtown area combined. You can see it in front and slightly to the left of the skyline in the image above. Closer to lunchtime, I began to roam through town in search of food. The heart of the city reminded me more of Portland than anything else – art, nature, and bikes everywhere. I found a Japanese supermarket without a single Latin character to be found inside it, and the workers helped me to some bags of loose leaf Japanese Sencha.

      <p>
        Over lunch, I realized that my plans to go back to Seattle the next day by two ferries going Vancouver to Victoria, Victoria to Seattle had crumbled because going from Victoria to Seattle was way out of my budget. I made a surprisingly not regrettable decision to go to Victoria and back right then and there. The trip ended up being 5 hours, one way, with only 2 hours of ferry in the middle. At least I got to meet a cute girl with a cute dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately I only had an hour to run around Victoria before I had to go back, because the final ferry left before sunset. Victoria had a very intriguing combination of outdated European and progressive American vibes. I hope to do more diligence to it when I return.

        On the way back to Vancouver, I witnessed what may have been the best sunset of the trip, falling right over the small islands between Vancouver and Victoria. I was lucky enough to have met Myles and Brayden, two locals my age, who demonstrated fascinating perspective and even offered to let me stay with them at their friends place in North Vancouver.

      <p> We got to their friend Dylan’s house, which had one of the gnarliest views of any city that I’ve seen. They graciously hosted me for the night and gave me a great sense of comfort that I didn’t expect to find so many thousands of miles from home. I am very impressed by the Canadian's taste in music – my Spotify library almost doubled after that night. I urge everyone to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkkcAh08vw">Logic’s The Incredible True Story</a> – it samples the most unforgettable excerpt of Alan Watts (at 2:58) I’ve ever heard. </p>

      <p> Brayden also convinced me to watch <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search/cow?jbv=80033772&jbp=0&jbr=0">Cowspiracy</a> – the most reality shattering piece of investigative journalism I’ve ever seen. It exposes corruption within environmental non-profits by debunking the misconception that fossil fuels are the primary cause of greenhouse gas emissions. In reality animal agriculture contributes equally, if not more, to global warming than fossil fuels, and the majority of that impact can be mitigated by simply not eating beef.

        Thank you Vancouver for providing quite a spiritually fullfilling conclusion to my journey. I am undoubledly lucky to have stumbled into all of these life-altering people among my journey, none of which I could have met under more traditional and rigid travel plans. I am forever thankful. I am forever altered.
